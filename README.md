# Danielle Ellis Portfolio 

## Overview 
This is a personal portfolio that showcases Danielle Ellis' projects, blog posts and more. It is a final project for the Flatiron School. The app is composed of backend rails API and front-end React Redux clients, which use asynchronous Javascript (with the help of redux-thunk middleware) to make HTTP requests to the API and render them to the user interface.

## The Backend
On the backend, you'll find Ruby on Rails. This app requires Ruby 3.0.0 and Rails 6. To get this running locally:

fork https://github.com/thedanielleellis/portfolio-backend & clone
cd portfolio/portfolio-backend from your local directory
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rails s

## The Frontend
On the frontend, you'll find React + Redux.
fork https://github.com/thedanielleellis/portfolio-frontend & clone
cd portfolio/portfolio-frontend from your local directory
npm start
open browser to localhost:3000
